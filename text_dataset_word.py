        The format is [[<sentence>], [<sentence>], ...], where <sentence> = [<word>, <word>, ...].

        For the IMDb data, this transforms a list of reviews (each is a single string) into a list of
        sentences, where each sentence is represented as a list of string words. So the elements of the
        resulting list are the i-th sentence overall. Note that this means that we lose information about WHICH review
        the sentence comes from, which is useful, but not needed in this project.

        reviews: Python list of str. len=N_reviews

            The int-coded target words in the corpus,
        tf.int32 tensor. shape=(N,).
            The int-coded context words.

        Every pair of target and context words occupy the i-th position of the target and context word lists that this
        function builds up. This means that there will likely be chains/sequences of repeating target words (when a
        target word has multiple context words in the context window, which is usually the case).

        Example:
        --------
        corpus = [['neural', 'nets', 'are', 'fun'], ...]
        word2ind: 'neural':0, 'nets':1, 'are':2, 'fun':3
        context_win_sz=1
        Then we will have:
        target_words_int =  [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
        context_words_int = [1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2]

        NOTE:
        - As the example above illustrates, the number of context words in the window is NOT constant because of
        sentence edge effects.
        - The length of target_words_int and context_words_int MUST be equal!
